# PyPassphrase
A simple Python script to generate passphrases.

## Usage

When downloading the script, if you want the default dictionaries provided make sure to use:

```git clone --recursive https://github.com/michaelstokesdev/PyPassphrase.git```

Otherwise feel free to add your own dictionaries to the dictionaries directory and use the ```-d```
argument to use them.

A number of useful configuration flags are provided, which can be found by running the script
with the ```-h``` help flag. These include the number of passphrases to generate, number of 
words in each passphrase, custom dictionary path, delimiter, and more script-friendly
output formatting.
